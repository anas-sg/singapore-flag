A Python script that draws the Singapore flag

## Description
This Python script uses the bundled turtle module to draw the Flag of Singapore to scale according to the technical specifications laid out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Construction_Sheet_of_the_Flag_of_Singapore.svg">here</a>.
